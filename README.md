To-do
* Add vertical line where SPE=0

* On Slack, they said be best to average the blocks for the first day, then average the blocks for the second day.  We would not be analyzing data for the third day.  This way, we are not crossing days when combining data. clarified the grouping is Epochs 1-2 and 3-4 for the 3-Day condition.
Blocks 2-7 day one 
9-14 day two

* Restrict the modeling standard deviation to less than 3?  Check sigmas for other data to argue they shouldnt be that small.

SKYPE MEETING 14 June

Upon scrutiny of the histograms , it became clear that there is not enough data for stable fits when breaking the data down into epochs of 3 blocks. Matt and Jackie will recommend another grouping.

e.g. epoch 1 and 2 vs. epoch 4 and 5
OR
epoch 2 and 3 together, epoch 4 and 5 together


Restrict the modeling standard deviation to less than 3?  Check sigmas for other data to argue they shouldnt be that small.


Jackie and Matt will screen Ss by catch trials - misses and false alarms


BLACKBOARD MEETING

How many trials needed to get a stable parameter estimate.

Standard deviation got sharper, in Jackie's analysis, but no difference with the control condition.

Martini paper, send them.

Epoch = group of 3 blocks.

Do Bayesian comparison.
