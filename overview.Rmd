```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

There are both "training" blocks, "practice" blocks (1,8,15, which I think were the first block of each day?), and "transfer" blocks (vary with day condition).

Ultimately want to analyze data broken down by:
* Group (determines in which serial positions the targets appeared)
* Condition (3-day, 2-day, 1-day)
* TargPos (target position this trial)
* Block (epochs of trials basically)

Analyzing that many would probably take all night. 

"Targets were in serial positions 3-14 for Group 3 in the training sessions.  Blocks 2-4 correspond to training for the 1-Day condition, 2-7 and 9-11 for the 2-Day condition, and blocks 2-7, 9-14, and 16-18 for the 3-Day condition (blocks 1, 8, and 15 were "practice blocks" of 10 or so trials).  So, Group 3 of the 3-Day condition would have the most data if you want target positions to be randomized.

We would also want to have the parameters for transfer for each target position (4, 7, 10, 13) separately from the training phase. This would be for the 1-, 2-, and 3-day conditions.

Finally, we would like to have parameters for the last epoch of training for each subject in the 1-, 2-, and 3-day conditions. An epoch is defined as 3 blocks.
"

Complications for interpretation of the data:

* The participant is allowed to report a stimulus that was not presented
* The participant is allowed to report 0, meaning they saw no target

This means that any change in efficacy or the other parameters could be a result of changes in bias rather than any change in attention.

Eventually should do some sort of data analysis to look at false alarms to assess bias changes.
